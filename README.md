# angular-scrollable-table

Provides a directive which converts a table to a scrollable one with a fixed header.

## Aims

* Modify the existing html as little as possible, with no modification of the original table.
* Existing user css is modified as little as possible, possibly adding css for the container element.

## TODO:
* Hide table until fully rendered to avoid flickering of header?
